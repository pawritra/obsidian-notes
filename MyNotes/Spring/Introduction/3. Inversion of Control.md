The design process of externalizing the construction and management of objects. Here it is managed by Object Factory.

Till now the way of creating Objects in Java is,
	1. We define the class for the object.
	2. We do something like
		Coach theCoach = new CricketCoach();

But here, we are hardcoding the object type, CricketCoach.

Here inversion of control kicks in.

We define the class but the creation of object is handled by the app configuration and thus we don't need to hardcode.

#### Spring Development Process
1. Configure your [[Glosary#^c64790|Spring Beans]]
2.  Create Spring Container
3.  Retrieve Beans from Spring Container

#### We can do this in 3 ways -
1.  [[3.1 IoC - XML Configuration|XML Configuration]] ( legacy )
2.  [[3.2 IoC - Annotations|Annotations]] ( modern )
3.  [[3.3 IoC - Source Code|Source Code]] ( modern )
